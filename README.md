# Face-Mask-Detection
This project trains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect whether a person is wearing a face mask or not. The trained model is integrated with OpenCV to allow real-time mask detection through video streams, making it ideal for safety and monitoring purposes.
Features: 
Binary Classification: Detects "With Mask" or "Without Mask."
Real-time Video: Uses OpenCV for real-time mask detection through a webcam feed.
Pre-Trained Model: Leverages transfer learning with the VGG16 model for efficient feature extraction.
